#### Module 2 - Truncate floating point number

Goal: Write a program which prompts the user to enter a floating point number and prints the integer which is a truncated version of the floating point number that was entered. Truncation is the process of removing the digits to the right of the decimal place.

This assignment is worth a total of 10 points:

3 points will be given if a program is written.

2 points will be given if the program compiles correctly.

3 points will be given for the first test execution, if the program correctly prints the truncated integer when a floating point number is entered.

2 points will be given for the second test execution, if the program correctly prints the truncated integer when another floating point number is entered.
